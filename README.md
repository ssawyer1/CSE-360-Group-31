This is a medical database system for a pediatrics facility. Coded by Maya Eleff, Samuel Sawyer, Nolan Takeshita, Benjamin Wallace, Sarah Wertheim.

What to do:
Convert all Current GUI Portals into "Scene" Methods that put all of the required contents into 1 scene and the return that scene. 
Additionally, we must implement a scene "swapping" mechanic into the main to swap the scenes when logging in as a doctor, nurse, or patient by calling the methods to set the stage with the proper stage. A good place to start is to move the login screen into the main because that will be our baseline screen where the use will start. Here is a link of a brief overview of what I have just said and the syntax to use: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24789506/javafx-change-scene-in-setonaction. One last note is that we want to create packages for importing into the main if possible so the code wont be so damn long. Needs some further looking into though.
